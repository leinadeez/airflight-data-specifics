## Airflight Data Specifics

Welcome to Airflight Data Specifics, your first choice in recovering flight infos and statuses.

To get it running is simple: All you need to do is place all the files present in this repository at an http-server, run it and open in your browser.

Once in it, just type in the number of your flight and voil√°! All the info is just there for you to read. Unless it's not, which usually means your desired info is not present in the API.
