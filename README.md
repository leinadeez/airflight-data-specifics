## Airflight Data Specifics

Welcome to Airflight Data Specifics, your first choice in recovering flight infos and statuses.

To get it running is simple: All you need to do is place all the files present in this repository at an http-server, run it and open in your browser.

Once in it, just type in the number of your flight and voil√°! All the info is just there for you to read. Unless it's not, which usually means your desired info is not present in the API.

This solution focuses on front-end only, and I chose to go without frameworks to keep it a simple application to solve a simple problem.

I chose to render all the DOM elements through javascript instead of HTML because it goes without saying that HTML by itself is really simple, but manipulating the DOM efficiently requires skill, so it made more sense to me that if I am to show my skills on both HTML and Javascript, I'd rather do it through pure Javascript. I also left out SCSS (my favorite css syntax style) for simplicity sake, and used flex instead of bootstrap for the same reason.

Were this a full-fledged application for production, I'd probably use Vue, Vuex and Axios, but you can see that on my other repo "nightmare-front-vue", which is a personal work in progress.
